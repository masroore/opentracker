This is opentracker. An open bittorrent tracker.

You need libowfat (http://www.fefe.de/libowfat/).

Steps to go:

fetch http://dl.fefe.de/libowfat-0.24.tar.bz2
tar xjf libowfat-0.24.tar.bz2
cd libowfat
make
cd ..
fetch http://erdgeist.org/arts/software/opentracker/opentracker-1.0.tar.bz2
tar xjf opentracker-1.0.tar.bz2
cd opentracker-1.0
make
./opentracker

This tracker is open in a sense that everyone announcing a torrent is welcome to do so and will be informed about anyone else announcing the same torrent. Unless 
-DWANT_IP_FROM_QUERY_STRING is enabled (which is meant for debugging purposes only), only source IPs are accepted. The tracker implements a minimal set of 
essential features only but was able respond to far more than 10000 requests per second on a Sun Fire 2200 M2 (thats where we found no more clients able to fire 
more of our testsuite.sh script).

Some tweaks you may want to try under FreeBSD:

sysctl kern.ipc.somaxconn=1024
sysctl kern.ipc.nmbclusters=32768
sysctl net.inet.tcp.msl=10000
sysctl kern.maxfiles=10240
